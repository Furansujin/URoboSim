# URoboSim
Import a URDF file into UE4 by drag & drop into the content browser. A new asset is created with the URDF information. Before dragging the asset into the game world, certain properties can be edited using a new visual interface found in the Editor Mode window.

As an optional feature, this project can be run with the UROSBridge plugin to control the imported robot from a ROS server through web sockets. 

Developed on UE4 version 4.16.
