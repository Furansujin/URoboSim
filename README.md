# URoboSim

A UE4 Plugin for importing URDF robots as a new asset type. Compatiable with the ROSBridgePlugin. 

Usage:
Filename must end with URDF or xml. Simply drag the file into the content browser (may need to wait a few seconds when dragging in) and the robot will be loaded as a new asset type which can then be dragged into the game world.
